In addition, we suggested that the novel method that we proposed for ocular artifacts removal, please reffered to https://github.com/Gaitxh/FCCJIA-An-adaptive-joint-CCA-ICA-method-for-ocular-artifact-removal, and paper "Gao X, Zhang S, Liu K, et al. An Adaptive Joint CCA-ICA Method for Ocular Artifact Removal and its Application to Emotion Classification[J]. Journal of Neuroscience Methods, 2023: 109841.", which method denoted the faster computation and more efficient computation!!!!!!
